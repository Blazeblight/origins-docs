# Action On Hit

[Power Type](../power_types.md)

Executes a bi-entity action when the entity that has the power has hit another entity.

Type ID: `origins:action_on_hit`

### Fields

Field | Type | Default | Description
------|------|---------|-------------
`bientity_action` | [Bi-entity Action](../bientity_actions.md) | | The action to execute upon hit.
`damage_condition` | [Damage Condition](../damage_conditions.md) | _optional_ | If set, the action will only trigger when this condition holds for the damage that was dealt by the entity that has the power.
`cooldown` | [Integer](../data_types/integer.md) | 1 | Interval of ticks this power needs to recharge before the action can be executed again.
`hud_render` | [Hud Render](../data_types/hud_render.md) | `{"should_render": false}` | Determines how the cooldown of this power is visualized on the HUD.
`bientity_condition` | [Bi-entity Condition](../bientity_conditions.md) | _optional_ | If set, the action will only trigger when this bi-entity condition is fulfilled.

### Example
```json
{
    "type": "origins:action_on_hit",
    "bientity_action": {
        "type": "origins:add_velocity",
        "z": 2
    }
}
```
This example adds velocity to the entity that's been hit by the entity that has the power, essentially granting the entity with this power extra knockback.
